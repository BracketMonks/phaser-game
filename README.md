# Phaser Game

### This is a game done with phaser , it is a basic arcade style game involving collecting stars and scoring points

### The pourpose is strictly for reasearch pourpose

### NOTE: I will expand upon this game to make it more fun

### Installing the game :

1. You need a webserver to run the game you could do this in a number of ways - fastest ways are MAMP, XAMPP, Setting a local server with vhost, gulp or grunt

#### I will include a gulp task manager with an optional webserver
